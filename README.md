# SAP-SD-SIMULATION
Developed a Java Swing–based SAP Sales Order Management simulation replicating real-world ERP sales workflows using OOP, CRUD operations, and MySQL.

Description:
The SAP Sales Order Management System is a Java-based desktop application that simulates the core functionalities of an enterprise-level SAP module for managing customers, products, and orders. The project replicates the sales workflow from customer creation to order placement, demonstrating the business logic behind ERP systems.
The application provides an intuitive Swing-based GUI where users can perform essential SAP-like operations such as adding customers, adding products, viewing all stored data, and placing new orders. Each module is connected logically to simulate real-world data flow in a sales environment.
This project was designed to strengthen understanding of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) concepts and SAP Sales & Distribution (SD) workflows, using Java to model backend logic and GUI components.

Technical Stack:
Language: Java
Framework/Library: Java Swing (for GUI)
Database: MySQL / SQLite (based on implementation)
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / NetBeans
Concepts Used: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Event Handling, CRUD Operations, GUI Design, Data Persistence

Key Features:
Add Customer: Register new customers with unique IDs and personal details.
Add Product: Add and manage product inventory including price, category, and stock.
View All Data: Display all customers, products, and orders in organized tables.
Place Order: Create new sales orders linking customers and products.
Exit Module: Securely close the application with confirmation.

Outcome / Learning:
Gained hands-on experience in ERP process simulation and SAP SD workflow understanding.
Strengthened practical skills in Java Swing application development.
Understood how enterprise systems integrate multiple modules for streamlined operations.
Developed project structure and data handling similar to SAP’s real business logic layers.
